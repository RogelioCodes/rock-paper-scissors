# rock-paper-scissors
The game was originally a console version of rock paper scissors. The player was to be prompted for a choice of rock paper or scissors and then be put up against the computer. The game is written in javascript.

I updated this to make it a simple web browser version. There is no styling. This was just to practice conditional logic and DOM manipulation.
